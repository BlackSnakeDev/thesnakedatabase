To prevent time-travel-related paradoxes, instead of changing the “original” past, time travel in 5D chess results in the creation of an alternate timeline or “parallel universe”, for which the starting position is the same as the corresponding time-point in the original timeline but with the time-traveling piece added. Pieces can also be sent between these different “timelines” and, when moving across timelines, can move into that timeline’s “past”, “present”, or “future”. Car Dealership Simulator",

Engardin was engulfed in flames, until a huge explosion known as “The Razing” devastated the Holy Grounds of mankind and brought a swift end to the conflict. But the divine order was broken, and lives withered away. The age of mankind came to an end. Roots of Pacha",

Such heathen were hunted, hanged, burnt, and staked, and their remains sealed within sanctified mausoleums. But what those fearfully foolish folk did not realise, is that those whom are already dead, cannot be killed. You are one such filthy Boneraiser!  As a reviled Boneraiser you must amass an army of skellies and deamons to fight the endless waves of heroes intent to end your necromantic ways",

Each time you land you’ll be closer to the peak and one step closer to mastering the platforming, but your fall down the mountain will be even farther. Bread and Fred are attached to each other. That means you don’t only fall together, but you can make good use of momentum to swing and propel each other beyond what any single penguin could have ever jumped.",

Buy, price, clean and sell your cars. Upgrade, improve, keep your car dealership clean and earn the respect of your customers, be the best car dealer around. Bargaining system can be added in sales as well as in purchases. I also skipped writing, I couldn’t figure out if there is a connection about the arrival of customers according to the profit rate of the vehicles, but if it is added, it would be great. In other words, if what I bought for 100 is sold for 105, if it is sold in x time, when I sell it for 107, it can be sold in 3x time.",

The player can attempt an “Active Reload” of a weapon to reload it faster and temporarily boost the damage from the gun, but failing to perform the Active Reload correctly will cause the gun to become momentarily jammed while the player’s character fixes it.",

You also need to watch out for her bear traps and other things lurking in the dark, like her pets, for example. You can hide in wardrobes and coffins but be careful that she does not see you where you are hiding. Tools Up! Ultimate Edition",

    "description": "Junkyard Truck is an open-world off road driving, mechanic simulator, and job simulator. Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You’ll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you’re low on funds.",

Was it that obvious? (You’re looking in every direction, but not up.) – Ah, this – I’ve already told you, haven’t I? (About what?) – Ah, you know, small stuff. (Can small stuff make you terrified?) – It’s hard to explain. I climb up the metal railing and let my legs hang down. I sneak short glances at the abyss from time to time. It replies with angry, cold breath. That’s how we interact. Like old friends. – Sometimes I feel like the whole world pretends to be crazy. – As if it’s trying to make me believe in something that doesn’t exist. (That’s weird, isn’t it?)",

    "description": "It was once your grandfather’s pride-and-joy, but your family ranch has fallen on hard times and it’s up to you to turn things around. Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region – either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer. The years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects.",

    "description": "Set in a parallel universe created by the suddenly appearing Serpent King Orochi, the “WARRIORS OROCHI” series consists of tactical action games where heroes from both the “DYNASTY WARRIORS” series and “SAMURAI WARRIORS” series join the action. This title offers all the content of “WARRIORS OROCHI 3”, as well as new characters designed by popular illustrator Akihiro Yamada (“Beast of East – Touhou Memairoku” and “The Twelve Kingdoms” [binding and illustrations]) joining battles and new episodes, which will allow players to enjoy the story even more deeply. In addition, it also includes numerous elements such as “Duel Mode”, which fuses elements of versus battles and card battles, the new “Gauntlet Mode”, which allows players to enjoy party battles, and a great number of DLC items that have already been released for other platforms! In addition to the heroes of “DYNASTY WARRIORS” and “SAMURAI WARRIORS”, “Kyūbi” and “Tamamo” characters designed by Akihiro Yamada, and more, the 145 unique heroes are a must-see An ensemble of characters across various titles join the spectacular battles, such as Kasumi from “DEAD OR ALIVE 5”, Sterkenburg Cranach from the “Atelier of Arland” series, and Sophitia from the “SOULCALIBUR” series. A “Sequel Story” to the main story “The Slaying of the Hydra” is added. Also, the mystery of the parallel world is revealed in a “Prequel Story” that uncovers the secret of Orochi’s birth. Sub-scenarios such as hypothetical battles and battles that unfold from different perspectives enrich the story, allowing players to enjoy the heroic drama of the world of “WARRIORS OROCHI 3” even more deeply. “Gauntlet Mode” has been included, allowing players to form parties of 5 people and take part in thrilling battles. Other game modes include the 3-on-3 “Duel Mode”, which fuses versus battles with card battles, as well as “Musou Battlefields” that provide players with more freedom.",
